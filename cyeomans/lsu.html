        <h3 class="lsu">LSU</h3>
        <p>Louisiana State University (LSU) is a college I began looking at during my sophomore year because of the merit scholarships offered, and the quality of their honors college. I find that I am most qualified to discuss whether or not LSU is fit for me because I spent a week of my last summer in Baton Rouge to look at the college. LSU is listed as my fall-back college only because I know I can attend there for very cheap, barring disaster. Their 25th to 75th percentile ACT scores are 23 to 28, and my 34 would put me in the 99th percentile for students (Niche, “College Admissions”). In addition, the Honors College only requires a 3.5 GPA alongside a 30 for my ACT composite score, so I should ideally also be a shoo-in for that (LSU Ogden Honors College, “Admissions”). However, LSU still presents a lot of competition, as I intend to apply for their “President’s Alumni Scholars Award” and their Stamps Scholarship, which both require a 33 ACT score, 3.5 GPA, and acceptance into the honor’s college (LSU, “Financial Aid and Scholarships”). I intend on competing for both scholarships, as the award is a completely full ride with “a potential $14,000 for enrichment experiences” from the Stamps Scholarship, and the same full ride with “a $2,000 study abroad stipend” from the “President’s Alumni Scholars Award” (LSU, “President’s Alumni Scholars Award”, LSU, “Stamps Scholarship”). Even if I cannot get either of these scholarships, I have a guaranteed fall-back for having gotten a 33 on the ACT of “$20,500 [per] year” thanks to the guaranteed “Flagship Scholars Award” (LSU, “Financial Aid and Scholarships”). These would greatly reduce the cost of college to something extremely manageable for my family, which would be a great boost. </p1>
        <br><br><p> However, I did not initially look at LSU because of their amazing scholarships. I was initially interested because of their resident Tiger, Mike. Louisiana State University has kept a tiger on their campus since Mike I was brought to LSU in 1936 (Mike the Tiger Official Site). From there I researched, and came to the conclusion that Louisiana State University was the right kind of atmosphere for me. While Mike VI was euthanized just last year due to cancer, Louisiana State University is searching for another tiger (Kirshner para. 1). Louisiana State University has the right campus atmosphere for me because it is not overly academic, however it still has many places for intellectual discussion. LSU is world-renowned for its amazing sports teams, however it also has many organizations I am interested in joining. There is a sizable (259 students) “College Republicans” club, which is significantly larger than the 97 member “College Democrats” club, and this demonstrates that political leanings on the campus align much more closely with my beliefs than anywhere I have lived (TigerLink, “Organizations Directory”). In fact, there is even a 24 member “College Libertarians” club, which would become 25 members as soon as I step foot on campus (TigerLink, “Organizations Directory”). I think that Louisiana State University offers me many opportunities not only socially and politically, but academically as well. </p1>
        <br><br><p>In a personal tour of the Ogden Honors College this past Summer given Academic Advisor Taylor Baudry, it was described to me that the honors college actually encourages second-year undergraduates to take at the very least one semester abroad in one of a multitude of colleges (Baudry interview). In addition, the honors college provides a very useful structure of the four undergraduate years. The college would help me provide focus in my first year of “service” in the community, “study abroad” during my second year, “internships and research” during my third year, and a special focus on my “honors thesis” during the fourth year (Baudry interview). This kind of structure would really fit my dual major of economics and political science. LSU does not require that I reapply for economics or political science, and does allow for me to double major (LSU, “College of Humanities and Social Sciences”). If I take my admission into the Ogden Honors College as a given, I think that Louisiana State University can provide me with exactly what I need out of a four year degree.</p1>
        <br><br><p>The greater Baton Rouge area is also significant in this decision. After having spent two weeks in Louisiana, and a week in Baton Rouge, I can confirm that I adore the area. The people of the South seem to be genuinely nicer than those who live in California, and race relations between black and white people seemed to be really good; however, those between black people and police officers specifically appeared fairly strained. However, that is an interaction I will hardly experience and I therefore think that the social environment in Baton Rouge is perfect for me. The food in Louisiana is spectacular, and the proximity to New Orleans is a major positive for LSU. In addition, the rent for off-campus dorms is great, and likely what I will end up doing. In a tour I took of the on-campus dorms, I was appalled with the resemblance to prison cells that the on-campus dorms exhibited. However, we had first looked at some off-campus housing options that looked very agreeable. One example is “The Armstrong”, which is around a five-minute bike ride from the campus itself, which offers four bed, two bath apartments for $450 per month (The Armstrong, “Floor Plan”). This relatively cheap housing will be very valuable in the decision making process of which college I wish to attend. Louisiana State University is a very realistic option for my college.</p1>
