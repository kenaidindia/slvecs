  I believe that you should not download music illegally. It is illegal and wrong. Not only that but you are stealing from the musician who put time into writing and producing the song. Finally if you cannot afford to pay $1.25 then you definitely cannot pay the fine for downloading illegal music. That fine will be much more than $1.25.
