<h1>
  Reason 1
</h1>
<p style=width:50%>
  The first reason people might download music illegally is because they do not have enough money. Many young people are too young to get a job and their parents will not pay for them to buy music. Also the music they are trying to buy could be very expensive and out of their price range.

<h1>
  Reason 2
</h1>
<p style=width:50%>
  The second reason that people might illegally download music is that people do not want to pay for the music they are downloading. This is because even though it may not cost much they still want to get it free instead of paying money for it. They know it is wrong but they do not care since it is free for them.

<h1>
  Reason 3
</h1>
<p style=width:50%>
  The final reason that people might illegally download music illegally is that they see others downloading the music and think it is ok. They may also think that it is ok to download music for free.
