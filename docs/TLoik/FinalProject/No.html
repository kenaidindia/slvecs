  Reason 1
</h1>
<p style=width:50%>
  The first reason that you should not download music illegally is because, well, it is illegal. You break the copyright rules by effectively stealing their music.

<h1>
  Reason 2
</h1>
<p style=width:50%>
  The second that you should not download music illegally is that the musician is not getting money for making music. If it is a small musician every dollar helps so when you illegally download you are stealing money from them. Even if it is a rich singer or band you should still buy their music to support them and show that you like their music.
