  The first reason that you should not download music illegally is because, well, it is illegal. You break the copyright rules by effectively stealing their music.

  Reason 2
</h1>
<p style=width:50%;margin-left:2%;>
  The second that you should not download music illegally is that the musician is not getting money for making music. If it is a small musician every dollar helps so when you illegally download you are stealing money from them. Even if it is a rich singer or band you should still buy their music to support them and show that you like their music.

  Reason 3
</h1>

  The final reason you should not download music is that you can get charged with serious fines. In 2013 a man was fined $675,000 for illegally downloading music. He illegally downloaded 5,000 songs. Even if he had paid $1.25 for each song he would only have paid $6,250 instead of $675,000.
