<h2>The Destruction of Nature</h2>
  <p>The plan to open many places, such as marine sanctuaries, to oil drilling would have many devastating effects, especially in the ocean. Marine life would have direct contact with oil and other hazardous substances. These substances can have severe effects on the health of not only the marine life, but the humans that live near.</p>

<h2>Oil Drilling and Climate Change</h2>
  <p>Oil drilling can have very devastating long term effects on the climate. "21 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, can be traced to oil, gas and coal extracted from federal lands, according to a December 2014 study by The Wilderness Society." -wilderness.org

Leaks and badly made infrastructure help contribute to some of the pollution. Most of these leaks are easily preventable, but are still allowed to happen.</p>
