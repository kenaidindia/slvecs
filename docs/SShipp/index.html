<h2>The President's Plan</h2>

  <p><img src="Users/p2/GitHub/docs/SShipp/img/trumpoilwells.jpg" style="float: left;">
    Recently the president has talked about opening up much of the U.S. coastline to oil drilling. "The U.S. Department of the Interior announced that it may conduct 16 auctions to open new oil and gas wells along the Atlantic and Pacific continental shelves. It will also sell 31 new leases near Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico." -The Atlantic This would include wells near Monterey Bay and San Francisco, with some more even farther north, near some coastal redwood parks. If this plan is adopted it would let oil companies expand pacific oil wells beyond southern California.</p>

<h2>The Natural Gas Industry</h2>
    <p><img src="" style="float: right;">
    9.8 million jobs, or about 5.6% of U.S. Employment, are created by the natural gas industry according to the PwC. Adding new oil and gas wells would crete many new jobs. These wells can also bring a lot of wealth into the areas where they are built. But this all comes at a cost, the health of our environment.</p>
