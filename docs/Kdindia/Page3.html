<i>There are many pros of becoming a Computer Programmer, and there are also many cons. One of the pros is that there are<br>
over 328,000 computer programming jobs in the United States. One of the cons is that 8% of those jobs will disappear by<br>
2024. There is a 3.8 out of 5 interest rating for those people that have been Computer Programmers, but a 2.4 interest rating<br>
for those who have not. One of the pros is that this is a full-time job that you usually keep for a couple years. One of the cons<br>
is that you will be spending the majority of your day sitting in front of a computer.It is also a career choice that is 73% men<br>
There is no discrimination though against either generation. In conclusion, you would have to like writing code for this job to suit you<br><i>
