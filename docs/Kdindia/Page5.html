            <i>Over the next ten years, there are going to be an opening of aroun 81,000 jobs in the computer programming<br>
              career. This says that if you want to become a Computer Programmer you will need to push yourself to be the best.<br>
              Now with so few job openings for Computer Programmers, there is a chance that their salary will go up as they become<br>
              sparser and sparser. Being a Computer Programmer is also a job you can keep for ten years. After those ten years, companies<br>
              usually fire and hire new Computer Programmers. This means that every year there are new job openings available. In conclusion<br>
              This job has a stable salary but it is slightly difficult to become one. Here is the link to the websiter where I got most of my informatio from<br>
