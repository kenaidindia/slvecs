       <p>Friedman presents the idea that economic freedom is a necessary precursor for true charitable action. He presents the examples of the modern voluntary hospital, Carnegieâ€™s libraries were formed, and many high quality universities which were all formed in the 19th century during the era of the greatest economic freedom in the United States. He argues that for the people to be charitable they must first be free, because the requirement of charitable giving through government coercion would effectively make the action devoid of any virtue it previously had. This leads Friedman to argue that people are most likely to give when they live within total freedom because mankind is inherently good and has proven itself to be inherently good. The market ought to be left free so that people can accrue enough wealth and be given the freedom to do with their excess wealth that would not be going to governmental purposes to instead donate to charities of their choice. </p>
