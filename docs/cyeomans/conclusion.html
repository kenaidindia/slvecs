<p class=conclusion>
    We can determine that each of these thinkers agreed that there needs to be some method or manner of the distribution of wealth to the lower classes in order to ease the inequity of society; however, each argued that government coercion to achieve such an end would be detrimental. While Carnegie and Friedman saw the solution as natrual, Singer sees the problem as one of grave importance which leaves a moral stain on every person who is incapable of donating their time and/or money to those in need.
   <br> <br>
    The problem of world poverty is a problem that each of us has a moral obligation to solve regardless of whether or not our government would coerce us to do so, and the issue of charity is one that each of us has an obligation to take part in regardless of whether or not we consider ourselves to be the charitable type or whether or not we think we have something to give. There is always something to give to our fellow man and we have an obligation to assist each other in these times of need.
