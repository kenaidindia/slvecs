      My final project website is about global warming and how we can stop it.

      Global warming, also referred to as climate change, is the observed century-scale
      rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related
      effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system
      is warming. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented
      in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid-19th century,
       and in paleoclimate proxy records covering thousands of years. wikipedia
