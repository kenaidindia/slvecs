If you really come down to it, there really is only one Donald Trump Pro: he is
not in favor of abortion. Naturaly that is a very diverse and controversile
topic. Many would say that he has absolutly no pros, at all. Others would say
that he is all pros. Needless to say, I do not agree with those people.

<h2>Voting For Trump</h2>
</div>
Weird. Crazy. Special. These are all words that people have used to describe
Americans. In a lot of cases, they would be correct, and a lot of the time
we're proud of it. But that does not mean that we had to elect a rasist, sexist,
 sexual abuser as president. Now, that can be argued, I was told by one of his
 fans that "he only raped people to get the vote of sexual abusers", as if that
 makes it ok. I understand voting for him. I do. He was different. He wasn't a
politian. He was a business man. A millionaire. He said what he thought. And on
one hand that that sounds good, but on the other, what on earth did your parents
 teach you? I was taught that if you had to say what you think, at least say it
 politely. But he doesn't even make an atempt.

   <h2>
Voting Because You're Religious
   </h2>
   <p>
  I'm a Christian and I know plenty of people who voted for Trump because they
  felt it was there Christian duty. Some of us don't believe in evolution. We
  aren't in favor of abortion and a lot of us believe that being homosexual is a
  sin. I know people who won't read a book, simply
  because it has a gay person in it. That's how they were raised. Whatever you
  believe, I bet you have a friend or family member, who has gon through a
  traumatic expirience, such as rape, bullying, rasism and sexism. Think about
  them and imagine it was you expiriencing it. How do you like him now?
