    <p style="color:red;">  For all of history humans have been building structures. From straw huts to advanced castles, there needs to be plans for these structures, these planners are known as architects.  Every building built myst pass a series of tests and requirements that are known as a code.

       When these requirements change, then the building is not up to code. When designing a building architects must know all of these requirements and know how to follow them.
