          According to sokanu.com Architects earn a median salary of $76,100 per year. Salaries typically start from $46,080 and go up to $125,520. What do architects do to earn this money? Architects think of, design, and plan a building before it is built. They work with civil engineers to have everything for a new building ready for construction workers, plumbers, and electricians to build the house by their schematics.
