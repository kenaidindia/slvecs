  <h2 style="color:lightblue;font-family:verdana;">Here are a few reasons why music piracy <i>shouldn't</i> be seen as acceptable.</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Music piracy hurts the economy. A Wikipedia article says this in a paragraph about music piracy: "In 2007, the Institute for Policy Innovation (IPI) reported that music piracy took $12.5 billion from the U.S. economy. According to the study, musicians and those involved in the recording industry are not the only ones who experience losses attributed to music piracy. Retailers have lost over a billion dollars, while piracy has resulted in 46,000 fewer production-level jobs and almost 25,000 retail jobs. The U.S. government was also reported to suffer from music piracy, losing $422 million in tax revenue.""</li>

      <li>Music priacy is a crime. Simply put, if a copyrighted song is downloaded without the creators permission, it is being stolen, and the action is punishable by law. The RIAA says, "Making unauthorized copies of copyrighted music recordings is against the law and may subject you to civil and criminal liability. A civil lawsuit could hold you responsible for thousands of dollars in damages. Criminal charges may leave you with a felony record, accompanied by up to five years of jail time and fines up to $250,000."</li>

      <li>It's just ethically wrong to steal the song that someone poured days, weeks, even months into. They made the song to gain a profit, and stealing that away should be treated the same as stealing anything, whether it be an apple from the farmer's market, an idea for a new product, or thousands of dollars from the bank accounts of innocent Americans.</li>
