  <h2 style="color:lightblue;font-family:verdana;"> Here are a few reasons why music piracy could be seen as acceptable:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li style="color:lightblue">A study conducted by Luis Aguiar and Bertin Martins using Nielsen “clickstream” data found no evidence that music piracy displaced the sales of music. "Perhaps surprisingly, our results present no evidence of digital music sales displacement. While we find important cross country differences in the effects of downloading on music purchases, our findings suggest a rather small complementarity between these two music consumption channels. It seems that the majority of the music that is consumed illegally by the individuals in our sample would not have been purchased if illegal downloading websites were not available to them. The complementarity effect of online streaming is found to be somewhat larger, suggesting a stimulating effect of this activity on the sales of digital music."</li>
