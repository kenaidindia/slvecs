  <h2 style="color:lightblue;font-family:verdana;"> Here are a few reasons why music piracy could be seen as acceptable:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>A study conducted by Luis Aguiar and Bertin Martins using Nielsen “clickstream” data found no evidence that music piracy displaced the sales of music. "Perhaps surprisingly, our results present no evidence of digital music sales displacement. While we find important cross country differences in the effects of downloading on music purchases, our findings suggest a rather small complementarity between these two music consumption channels. It seems that the majority of the music that is consumed illegally by the individuals in our sample would not have been purchased if illegal downloading websites were not available to them. The complementarity effect of online streaming is found to be somewhat larger, suggesting a stimulating effect of this activity on the sales of digital music."</li>

      <li>Someone could hear a song that they think would fit perfectly with a prokect that they're working on. Unfortunately for them, the song is copyrighted. Even though they weren't planning on using the song to gain a profit, the song can only be obtained through piracy. A good example is in a game I used to play, called Geometry Dash. In this game, you control a square and have to jump through levels highly based on the song playing in the background. In the editor, people can go online and find a song that they would like to make a level of. A player will pick their song and begin to make the level. During the process, the song gets copyright-struck and is taken down. Even though the level can't make a profit, the song is not allowed for use. However, through piracy, people can copy the original song and repost it for people to use for their levels. The song isn't losing profit, since the only profit Geometry Dash makes is off of purchases of the application.</li>

      <li>Pirating music could be a way of popularizing a song. True, the song is being stolen, but free music is much more popular than costly music. Especially for unknown musicians with talent, if a song is pirated and shared, their music is essentially being advertized for free.
