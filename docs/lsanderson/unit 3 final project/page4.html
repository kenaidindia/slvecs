      Although I will not truely know what I would do if I were in this <br>
      scenario, I'd like to think I'd switch the lever to save 5 people rather than <br>
      saving one. Though for my explanation I think Emrys Westacott from ThoughCo. can <br>
      explain it better than I. "Simply put, this doctrine states that it is morally acceptable <br>
      to do something that causes a serious harm in the course of promoting some greater <br>
      good  if the harm in question is not an intended consequence of the action but is, <br>
      ather, an unintended side-effect.  The fact that the harm caused is <br>
      predictable doesnâ€™t matter.  What matters is whether or not the agent intends it."
