      Let us say that the subject decides to shift the lever to save the group <br>
      of five and the train runs over the one person. Again I will show 3 reasons <br>
      for this side of the dilemma.

  <h2>
Reason 1
  </h2>
  <p>
Although we are talking about human lives from a utilitarian point <br>
of view this path is a no-brainer because "our duty is to promote <br>
the greatest happiness of the greatest number". Five lives saved is <br>
better than one life saved.
  </p>
  <h2>
Reason 2
  </h2>
  <p>
The fact that you are trying to promote some greater good outways the <br>
harm as it is only a side effect to your good intent.
  </p>
  <h2>
Reason 3
  </h2>
  <p>
"Studies show that the majority of people today, at least in modern <br>
Western societies say that they would pull the lever." Given this, <br>
this choice is popularly chosen so more likely than not you probably <br>
agree with this choice. <!-- or something... i dont know-->
