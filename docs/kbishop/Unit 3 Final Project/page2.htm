        The Road to Becoming a Neurologist
      </h1>
      <p>
        Neurology and the pathway to becoming a neurologist is one that stresses the importance of determination and dedication to
         the career. In total, the absolute minimum number of years spent in schooling and training to become a neurologist is
         twelve years, which can be divided into four (necessary) segments: undergraduate degree, medical school, internship,
         and residency.
      </p>

        Undergraduate Degree
      </h2>
        <p>
A third of the twelve years spent schooling and training for the profession are spent during the process of achieving your 
          undergraduate degree. Majoring in sciences are recommended (biology, chemistry, etc.) as a way to prepare oneself with 
          the MCAT (Medical College Admission Test),  a computer-based test required by most medical schools if a student would 
          like to enroll. During the duration of the test, verbal reasoning, biological and physical sciences, writing skills, and 
          verbal reasoning skills are tested. In total, the maximum number of points that can be scored on the test is 528, with an
          average score of 125 in each section.
        </p>

        Medical School
      </h2>
      <p>
Once accepted to an accredited medical school, three to four years (recommended) of a Medical Doctor (MD) is necessary to continue
        on the path to studying and treating neurological diseases. 
      </p>
      <h2 style="color:#73b9d491;text-align:left-align:25px">
Internship
    </h2>
    <p>
During the twelve months spent in an internship, this year-long process allows for a training atmosphere alongside licensed doctors
and is a required step towards pursuing any doctoral career. After receiving a medical degree, students-- nearly licensed doctors --
are given the opportunity to train and practice under the guidance of professionals, allowing for the advanced training required of
      them.
