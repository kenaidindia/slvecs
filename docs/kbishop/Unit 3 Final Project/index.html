What is Neurology?
  </h2>
<p>
  Neurology is often described as the study of the nervous system-- made up of the central
  nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS)-- through a medical and
  scientific approach, delving into the functions, anatomy, and organic disorders among
  the system.

  What is a Neurologist?
</h3>
<p>
  A neurologist caters to diseases manifested in the nervous system, which can span
   anywhere from movement, cerebrovascular disorders,  seizure, spinal cord, headache,
  or speech and language disorders. In the treatment of such diseases, various
   treatments and tests can be done to diagnose patients; imaging tests such as MRI,
   CT, and PET scans are frequented in the field, as are lumbar punctures (a test
   conducted to analyze spinal fluid) and electroencephalograms, also called EEGs
   (the testing of electrical activity in one's brain using electrodes applied to the
  scalp).
