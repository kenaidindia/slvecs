    </h1>
    <h3>
      To find a respectful job as a pharmaceutical scientist a 4 year bachelor degree is needed.
      It is recomended to major in cheistry or chemical engineering if the college you are attending
      does not offer pharmaceutical sciences as a major. Classes that are important to this field include,
      pharmacology, chemistry, anatomy, biology, and mathematics.
      <br>
      While some jobs will accept just 4 years in school a masters or doctoral degree is greatly valued.
      This is 4-6 years of schooling and typically research experiance is necessary.
      <br>
      For students thinking about this carrer it is important for them to know most of the job is
      gathering, analyzing, and understanding medical data.
