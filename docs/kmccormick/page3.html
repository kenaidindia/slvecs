      Job Options and Benefits
    </h1>
    <h3>
    Inside pharmaceutical companies there are many jobs to fill. The main decision
    you need to make is if you want to be in the discovery, development, or manufacturing
    of the drugs getting developed.
    <br>
    There are many departments inside a company and can be placed in one of these three areas.
    The first is research and development where scientists are in the lab finding molecules
    to improve medications or create new ones. Next is reglatory affairs where you keep track if
    all the regulations are being followed so the medication can be sold to the public.
    Then, validation which is the job tracking how the medicine is made so it can be reproduced
    to be sold. Another area inside a company is production, these people are making the medicine
    that is being used worldwide. Finally, there is quality control, where they check
    the manufacturing process to make sure the product is safe.
