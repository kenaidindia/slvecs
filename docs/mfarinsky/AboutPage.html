<p>
Culinary Arts originated in the Western World as a craft and later became a field of study. It began to evolve
in the end of the Renaissance period. Chefs worked in castles before Monarchy was phased out as a modality
which is when they took their craft to inns and hotels, and from there it evolved into a study. A lot of the
study of Culinary Arts in Europe was organized by  Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. A similar path in Asia led to
a seperate study of Culinary Arts which later merged with Western Counterpart. Modern Culinary Arts students
study a wide variety of aspects of food. Specific areas are butchery, chemistry and thermodynamics, visual
presentation, food safety, human nutrition and physiology, international history, the manufacture of food items. Training
in culinary arts is possible in most countries usually at a University level.
