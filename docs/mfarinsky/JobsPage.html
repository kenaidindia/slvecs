Technology has been developing at a very fast pace over last 15 years and it has created an impact on all life
aspects of people along with it. It has even changed how people cook their meals. There are a lot of websites
dedicated to cooking that have been popping up in the last couple of years. Most of these sites have recipes that
are easy to follow and excecute with clear instruction and measurements. People prefer looking through these ssites
for specific recipes instead looking through a traditional recipe book. There are thousands of recipes available
through the internet. People who have special diets can also find recipes to make a delicious meal while following
their diet whether it be gluten free, lactose intolerant, vegan, vegatarian, and etc. This way people can use new
recipes instead of repeating the same one that follows their special diet. And people who own a tablet can set it up
and while cooking to look for something new to try like different spices or method of prep. And it has been shown
that a little over 40% of professional chefs search online before they prepare a new dish. A lot of people also enjoy
enjoy watching various cooking videos on streaming sites such as video whether it be comedic a new recipe or a
challenge to make a pro struggle. It also makes it easier to watch and learn then going to a class you can follo
the steps of the chef in the video. Also if there is a specific spice that you need for a recipe and your local
store does not have it then you are able to purchase it online. There are also community forums where chefs will share
their knowledge, dishes, and their tips for the kitchen. Technology has affected cooking in even more ways and it
continues to influence a persons everyday life more and more as the years pass and it will only continue to evolve.
